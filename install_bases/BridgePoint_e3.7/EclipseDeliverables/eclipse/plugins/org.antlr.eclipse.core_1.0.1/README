Core for ANTLR 2.7.2

Features:
  - project nature with incremental builder for ANTLR grammar files
  - conversion of ANTRL tool error output into resource markers

Requirements:
  - Eclipse 2.1
  - ANTLR plugin 'org.antlr_2.7.2'

Important:
  - Disable Eclipse's Java compiler from copying ANTLR grammar file to the
    output directory by adding '*.g' to the filtered resources in the
    preferences (Window/Preferences/Java/Compiler/Other)!!!

Todo:
  - save grammar file if IObjectActionDelegate 'Compile Grammar' is invoked

History:
0.1.0
	- initial version -> not published
0.1.1
	- first public version
0.1.2
	- AntrlTool uses now own implementation of antlr.ToolErrorHandler
	  (parsable error messages from Java code generator)
0.1.3
	- derived flag is set for generated files
	- better ANTLR error parsing (filtered "aborting grammar" messages)
	- added debug support (configurable via ".options" file)
	- incremental project builder is now added/removed correctly
0.1.4
	- during plugin startup "*.g" is added to JDT builder's copy
	  exclusion filter
	- every file generated by ANTLR is marked with persistent property
	  holding the according ANTLR grammar file - this is used in
	  UI plugin by the label decorator
1.0.0
	- updated to ANTLR 2.7.2 final
1.0.1
	- outline grammar now supports iso-8859-15 characters and parser exceptions
	  are recognized too
	- added resource properties for ANTLR compiler's output path and list of
	  super grammar files
	- builder now supports ANTLR compiler options '-o' and '-glib'
